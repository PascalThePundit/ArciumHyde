# COMPOSABILITY FRAMEWORK IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## Overview
This framework will provide reusable, interoperable privacy primitives that can be combined to create complex privacy workflows.

## Core Components to Implement:

### 1. Primitive Interface & Registry System
- PrivacyPrimitive interface defining standard methods
- PrimitiveRegistry for discovery and management
- Plugin architecture for extending functionality

### 2. Core Privacy Primitives
- Basic encryption/decryption
- Zero-knowledge proof generation
- Selective disclosure
- Range proofs
- Balance proofs
- Membership proofs

### 3. Composability Engine
- Workflow composer for chaining operations
- Privacy operation chaining system
- Cross-protocol privacy bridges

### 4. Client-side Components
- Composability playground for developers
- Registry browser
- Primitive documentation system

### 5. Cross-dApp Integration
- Standardized interfaces
- Interoperable privacy components
- Cross-dApp interaction protocols
